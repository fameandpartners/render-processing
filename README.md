## Purpose
The purpose of these scripts was two fold.  First there are a set of scripts that were dedicated to moving raw renders into Caddy, in their individual pieces.  Second there are a set of scripts dedicated to combining all of the raw renders, which are just pieces of a complete render, together into a complete set of images representing all possible combinations.  This second case also outputs a number of different cuts for use on the website. 

Please note that all of this is based on the pre-heirarchy model for customizing bridesmaids dresses and will need to be radically re-written to make work with the heirarchical based customization system now being used by the bridesmaids project.

## AMI
All of these scritps are meant to run on a specific AMI snapshot stored in the Northern California AWS Region.
